# INFT2051app (Uni Pets)

A number of changes have been made to ensure a successful android build/upload and Qol changes and will be addressed here.

1. Pet sprites have been updated as well as additional 'rare' variants that can be obtained by chance upon starting a new game
2. The pet will die at 0hp, and when doing so, is unable to make any movements.
3. Restarting will only occur when the user already has over 50 credits, which ensures the player from not spamming the restart button
4. Cleaning and Playing cost money, and when having insufficient money, will be indicated by the credits text in the background.
5. Sound has been removed as there is only one track and the media player notification is not intended for that use.
6. Player can just change both player and pet names simply by changing the textboxes. This makes it easier for both player and the efficiency of the codebase.
7. All icons have been updated to have a black/white theme in game
8. App icon has also been updated to match the new pet sprite changes in the game.
9. Fingerprint sensing has been removed as it's intended use was to add an extra gimmick.

At this point it isn't viable to upload this as a finished project for App Development, but I don't really care because we already finished the course.
