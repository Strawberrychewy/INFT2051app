# INFT2051app

Current Functionality:
1. Background Step Counter (App must still be running and not completely closed to count shakes)
2. FoodShop functional (Can buy food items using the popup menu)
3. Options popup works but does not affect anything yet
   - Mute button and slider both linked for a truly immersive experience when the user decides to play with the volume
4. Feeding with Food bought from the store now fully functional for both devices with and without fingerprint sensors
   - An onscreen button will show up, prompting the user to smash that like button
5. Pet moves (Horizontally) to the point touched on the screen (excluding button regions), just a gimmick and does not really do anything meaningful
